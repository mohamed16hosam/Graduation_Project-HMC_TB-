# Graduation_Project-HMC_TB-
In our project, we start by creating a verification plan after reading the documentations of the design and list all its features and functionality. Perform functional verification by using self-checking testbenches for all different scenarios then report the coverage. The Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) is a standardized methodology for verifying integrated circuit designs. It’s derived mainly from the Open Verification Methodology (OVM). We will build a UVM testing environment architecture using SystemVerilog HVL language going through development and debugging phases till we achieve complete coverage. Hence our project is implementing a UVM environment of the OpenHMC (Hybrid Memory Cube) Controller.
• My role: I was responsible for the reactive agent “HMC agent”, that responds to the initialization and request packets sent to it through its interface, and its interface and sequences.
